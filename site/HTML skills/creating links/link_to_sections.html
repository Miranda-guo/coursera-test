			<b> When You Are Old by William Butler Yeats </b><br>
		When you are old and grey and full of sleep,<br>
		And nodding by the fire, take down this book,<br>
		And slowly read, and dream of the soft look<br>
		Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;<br>

		How many loved your moments of glad grace,<br>
		And loved your beauty with love false or true,<br>
		But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,<br>
		And loved the sorrows of your changing face;<br>

		And bending down beside the glowing bars,<br>
		Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled<br>
		And paced upon the mountains overhead<br>
		And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.<br>
		
		<br>
		
		<b>The Wild Swans at Coole by William Butler Yeats</b><br>
		The trees are in their autumn beauty,<br>
		The woodland paths are dry,<br>
		Under the October twilight the water<br>
		Mirrors a still sky;<br>
		Upon the brimming water among the stones<br>
		Are nine and fifty swans.<br>

		The nineteenth Autumn has come upon me<br>
		Since I first made my count;<br>
		I saw, before I had well finished,<br>
		All suddenly mount<br>
		And scatter wheeling in great broken rings<br>
		Upon their clamorous wings.<br>

		I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,<br>
		And now my heart is sore.<br>
		All’s changed since I, hearing at twilight,<br>
		The first time on this shore,<br>
		The bell-beat of their wings above my head,<br>
		Trod with a lighter tread.<br>

		Unwearied still, lover by lover,<br>
		They paddle in the cold,<br>
		Companionable streams or climb the air;<br>
		Their hearts have not grown old;<br>
		Passion or conquest, wander where they will,<br>
		Attend upon them still.<br>

		But now they drift on the still water<br>
		Mysterious, beautiful;<br>
		Among what rushes will they build,<br>
		By what lake’s edge or pool<br>
		Delight men’s eyes, when I awake some day<br>
		To find they have flown away?<br>
		<br>
		<b> Sweet Rose of Virtue 
		by William Dunbar [1460-1525]
		translation by Michael R. Burch</b><br>

		Sweet rose of virtue and of gentleness,<br>
		delightful lily of youthful wantonness,<br>
		richest in bounty and in beauty clear<br>
		and in every virtue men hold most dear―<br>
		except only that you are merciless.<br>

		Into your garden, today, I followed you;<br>
		there I found flowers of freshest hue,<br>
		both white and red, delightful to see,<br>
		and wholesome herbs, waving resplendently―<br>
		yet everywhere, no odor but rue.<br>

		I fear that March with his last arctic blast<br>
		has slain my fair flower and left her downcast;<br>
		whose piteous death does my heart such pain<br>
		that, if I could, I would compose her roots again―<br>
		so comforting her bowering leaves have been. <br></p>

		<pre>
		When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
		I all alone beweep my outcast state,
		And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
		And look upon myself and curse my fate,
		Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
		Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,
		Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope
		With what I most enjoy contented least;
		Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
		Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
		(Like to the lark at break of day arising
		From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;
		For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings
		That then I scorn to change my state with kings.

		<pre>
		I came to you one rainless August night.
		You taught me how to live without the rain.
		You are thirst and thirst is all I know.
		You are sand, wind, sun, and burning sky,
		The hottest blue. You blow a breeze and brand
		Your breath into my mouth. You reach—then bend
		Your force, to break, blow, burn, and make me new.
		You wrap your name tight around my ribs
		And keep me warm. I was born for you.
		Above, below, by you, by you surrounded.
		I wake to you at dawn. Never break your
		Knot. Reach, rise, blow, Sálvame, mi dios,
		Trágame, mi tierra. Salva, traga, Break me,
		I am bread. I will be the water for your thirst.</p>
